# PANPROVA
## PANgenomic PROkaryotic eVolution of full Assemblies 

***PANPROVA*** is a computational tool for simulating pangenomic evolution by evolving the complete genomic sequence of an ancestral isolate. 
In this way, the possibility of operating at the pre-assembly stage is enabled. 
Gene set variations, sequence variation and horizontal acquisition from a pool of external genomes are the evolutionary features of the tool.

----

## Briefly description 

***PANPROVA*** evolves a single root genome into a population of synthetic genomes. The user can specify the phylogenomic relationships between the genomes in the population or leave the tool to create a random phylogenomic tree. 
Genomes are evolved from their parent by mutating nucleotides, by duplicating vertically transmitted genes or by altering the set of genes that are present in them via gene removal or acquisition of new horizontal genes.
A nucleotide substitution matrix is employed for nucleotide alterations. Mutation never create or remove exiting start and stop codons. 
The horizontal acquisition of new genes is made by picking genetic sequences from a previously created pool or by randomly creating their sequence. 
The user can specify the probability of a gene to be mutated, thus for each mutated gene the probability of a nucleotide to be mutated; the probability of duplicating a vertically transmitted gene and the percentage of the resultant gene set that as to be altered, by further specifying the probability of adding or removing a gene.

### Extractiong of HGT pool

The pool of HGT genes to be used during the evolution simulation is extracted from a set of input genomes (in PEG format) and by taking into account genes that are already present in the root genome (still in PEG format).
The following picture illustrates the main steps of the extraction procedure.

![createhgt](createhgt.png)

From the given input genomes, a set of genes that are not similar to the genes present in the root genome is initially extracted. Then a nonredundant pool of genes is created by discarding genes that are similar to other genes in the initial set. 
The similarity among nucleotide genetic sequences is computed by taking into account the similarity between their k-mer content [1]. In particular, a Jaccard similarity between k-mer multisets of two genetic sequences is computed. Genes with a similarity greater than 0.3 with root genes are discarded. Successively, we set an arbitrary order of the surviving genes. Then, each gene is compared with genes that come after it in the ordering. If the similarity is greater than 0.5, then the latter gene is marked to be discarded. At the end of the scanning, all the genes that were marked are removed from the HGT pool.

### Evolution procedure

The workflow of the evolution procedure, together with examples of intermediate data, is shown in the following figure. 

![evolve](evolve.png)

The workflow refers to the case in which the generation of the random phylogenomic tree is integrated into the process.
<br/>

At each step, a genome from the current population is chosen to be the parent of the next genome to be created. Thus, the parent genome is cloned and an initial version of the child genome is produced (see example 1 of the figure). 
<br/>

Then, according to a given probability, each vertically transmitted gene is selected to be altered or not. If yes, its loci are variated according to a given variation percentage. Possible variations are substitution (in accordance with the specified probability substitution matrix), insertion or deletion. Any modification is applied such that it does not produce or modify any star or stop codon of genes that overlap the gene that is currently modified. Overlapping genes may reside on both strands.
Becuse valid genetic sequences must be provided, subsitution regards one nucleotided at time, while insertion and deletion regard 3 nucleotides a time, such that the length of the resultant sequence is still a multiple of 3.
<br/>

Subsequently, variated vertically transmitted genes are selected to be duplicated within the new genome according to a given probability. 
<br/>

Duplication, insertion of HGT genes and transposition of genes is made such that a random locus of the genome is chosen. the locus must not be covered by any other gene. Thus, the genetic sequence of the gene, together with start and stop codons, is inserted at the selected locus. See examples 2 and 4 of the figure.
The resultant gene set is modified by a given percentage. If the set is composed of n genes and 2% of the set has to be variated, then (n/100)x2 variation operations are performed. such operation can be a horizontal gene acquisition of a gene removal. If the probability that an operation is acquisition is p, then the probability that the operation is a removal is 1-p.
<br/>

In the case of gene removal, a gene is randomly chosen to be removed. All the nucleotides that belong to the selected gene are removed from the genome if they do not overlap other genes. See example 3 of the figure.
<br/>

In case of gene acquisition, if the HGT pool is not empty, a genetic sequence is randomly chosen from the pool, inserted in the genome and removed from the pool. See example 4 of the figure. If the HGT pool is empty, a purely random nucleotide sequence is generated and inserted within the genome.
<br/>

Subsequently, the resultant set of genes is randomly picked for transposition according to a given probability. 
<br/>

Lastly, the new genome is added to the population and the process is repeated until the desired number of genomes is produced. Every time a new genome is produced, its parenting relationships are recorded. In particular, the information regarding the genome from which it has been cloned is stored. In addition, for each gene in the new genome, the information regarding the parent gene is stored. for vertically transmitted genes, such information reports the identifiers of the gene present in the parent genome. For duplicated genes, such information reports the identification of the paralog gene from which the gene has been duplicated. for horizontally transmitted genes, such information is null. See example 5 of the figure.

## File formats and internal identifiers

### .PEG
A .PEG file contains the nucleotide sequence of a genome together with the coordinates of its genes. 
The first line of the file is the nucleotide sequence, which must be in upper case and can only contain the following characters: A,C,G,T,N.
Subsequent lines report genetic coordinates, each gene for each line. Coordinates are in the form  start_position end_position strand, which are separated by a space character.
Start and end positions are integer numbers and always refer to position 0 of the 5â€™-3â€™ strand, even if the gene is located in the other strand. The values of the strand are 1 or -1 for 5â€™-3â€™ and 3â€™-5â€™ respectively.
 
### .genome_parents (or .tree)
A genome parents file reports the parenting information of the genomes in the produced population. 
The root genome is identified with the number 0 and its parent is -1.
The file contains multiple lines, one for each genome in the collection.
Each line contains two integers separated by a space character. The first integer is the identifier of a given genome, the second integer is the identifier of its parent genome.

### .genome_sequences
A genome sequences file reports the nucleotide sequence of each generated genome.
The file contains multiple lines, one for each genome. In each line, the numeric identifier of the genome is followed by a space and subsequently by the entire nucleotide sequence of the genome.

### .gene_parents
A .gene_parents file reports the parenting information of every gene that is present in the produced population of genomes.
Each line of the file reports the parenting information regarding a single gene, and it is in the format  genome_id gene_id parent_genome_id parent_gene_id.
The four identifiers are separated by a space character.
Genes of the root genome have -1 -1 parent, and the same applies to genes that have been horizontally acquired.
The parent of a duplicated gene is the paralog gene that is the source of the duplication, thus the gene that was already present in the same genome. This means that only for duplicated genes genome_id is equal to parent_genome_id.

### .genes
A .gene file contains the information regarding all the genes that are presented in the generated population. Each line of the file regards a single gene.
Lines are in the form:
```
genome_id:gene_id:(start_poistion,end_poistion,strand) sequence
```
Thus, there is a space between the first part of the line and the nucleotide sequence of the given gene.
Start and end positions are integer numbers and always refer to position 0 of the 5â€™-3â€™ strand, even if the gene is located in the other strand. The values of the strand are 1 or -1 for 5â€™-3â€™ and 3â€™-5â€™ respectively.
