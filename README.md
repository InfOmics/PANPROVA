# PANPROVA
## PANgenomic PROkaryotic eVolution of full Assemblies 

PANPROVA is a computational tool for simulating pangenomic evolution by evolving the complete genomic sequence of an ancestral isolate. 
In this way, the possibility of operating at the pre-assembly stage is enabled.
Gene set variations, sequence variation and horizontal acquisition from a pool of external genomes are the evolutionary features of the tool.
